# calc

This package powers the Pok√©mon Showdown damage calculator, providing a
programmatic interface for computing damage ranges. While the top level package
houses UI and view logic, this sub package contains code which will run on both
the server or browser, and can be used as a building block for alternative UIs
or applications.

This package is also distributed under the terms of the [MIT License][1].
